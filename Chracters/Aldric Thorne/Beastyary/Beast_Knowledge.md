# What Aldric Knows About Singing Creatures 🎵

### **Fey Creatures** 🧚‍♀️
Your academic training recalls several key facts about fey:

**Weaknesses:**
- **Cold Iron** - Pure iron that hasn't been heated in a forge is particularly effective against fey[1][2]
- **Salt** - Has power against fey magic and can disrupt their abilities[3]
- **Running Water** - Many fey cannot cross running water easily[2]
- **True Names** - Knowing a fey's real name gives you power over them[3]
- **Binding Promises** - Fey cannot break their word once given, though they twist meanings[2]
- **Cannot Tell Direct Lies** - They speak in half-truths and misdirection[2]

### **Sirens** 🌊
Your knowledge of maritime legends provides insight:

**Weaknesses:**
- **Physical Fragility** - Despite magical power, their bodies are vulnerable[4]
- **Dependency on Voice** - If they cannot sing, their power diminishes greatly[4]
- **Limited Range** - Must be close to victims for their songs to work[4]
- **Deafness** - Cannot affect those who cannot hear them[4]

### **Naiads** 🌊

**Basic Nature:**
- **Water fey** that inhabit fresh water sources - springs, streams, pools
- **Chaotic neutral** alignment - not inherently evil, but unpredictable
- **Amphibious** - can breathe both air and water
- **Invisible when fully submerged** - making them nearly impossible to target underwater

**Magical Abilities:**
- **Innate spellcasters** with charm-based magic
- **Hypnotic Pattern** - can entrance multiple victims at once (explains Mira's state)
- **Illusion magic** - can create false images and sounds
- **Psychic attacks** - can damage minds directly without physical harm

**Tactical Weaknesses:**
- **Magic resistance** but not immunity - spells can still affect them
- **Vulnerable when maintaining concentration** - disrupting their focus breaks enchantments
- **Limited to water sources** - cannot stray far from their aquatic home
- **Curious nature** - often distracted by interesting objects or people
